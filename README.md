# Challenge-3: Password Generator

## Purpose
In order to develop a user-friendly password generator, input elements for entering password length and
selecting character types were generated with JavaScript. When a user clicks "Generate Password", a function checks that there is sufficient user input:a selected password length between 8-128 characters, and at least one character type selected. If those conditions are fulfilled, then a password is generated by generating a random characters based on that criteria. If a randomly generated password does not contain at least one of the selected character types, then a new one is generated until it does.

## Design
The dynamically generated elements are given name attributes, and this is taken advantage of for generating passwords based on what options are selected. Before the password is generated, a for loop iterates through all of the input checkboxes and a separate array is filled with the names of those checked boxes. Those names are used for a switch statement nested within a for loop that iterates as many times as the password length to generate each character. Every iteration, a random index is generated for the selected checkboxes array which gives one of the chosen character types, which is the input of a switch statement to generate the random character based on a list of characters that are also randomly selected. Once the password has been made, then a for loop which iterates as many times as there are checked boxes, verifies that the password contains all selected character types at least once. Pseudo code is given below:

```
boxes_checked = ALL_CHECKED_BOX_NAMES;

// Generating the random password
for (password.length) {
    random_index = random_int() * boxes_checked.length;

    random_char_type = boxes_checked[random_index];

    switch (random_char_type) {
        case LWR_CASE:
            lwr_chars = 'a-z';
            random_lwr = random(lwr_chars);

            random_password += random_lwr;
            break;

        case UPR_CASE:
            upr_chars = 'a-z';
            random_upr = random(upr_chars);

            random_password += random_upr;
            break;
            
        case NUMERIC:
            random_num = random();

            random_password += random_num;
            break;
            
        case SPECIAL:
            spe_chars = '!-&';
            random_spe = random(spe_chars);

            random_password += random_spe;
            break;
            
    }
}

// Validating the password
for (boxes_checked.length) {
    char_to_check = boxes_checked[i];

    switch (char_to_check) {
        case LWR_CASE:
            if (no_lwr_char) {
                random_password = generatePassword();
            }
            break;

        case UPR_CASE:
            if (no_upr_char) {
                random_password = generatePassword();
            }
            break;
            
        case NUMERIC:
            if (no_num_char) {
                random_password = generatePassword();
            }
            break;
            
        case SPECIAL:
            if (no_spe_char) {
                random_password = generatePassword();
            }
            break;
    }
}
```
